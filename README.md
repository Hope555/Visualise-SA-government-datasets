## Project Specification

<b>Aim</b>: Develop a tool to allow a user to select one or more dataset(s) from the Data SA repository and display them on a map as overlays.

<b>Background</b>: The South Australia Government Data Directory provides an index of datasets. Many of these datasets are Geographic Information Systems (GIS) records with accompanying KMZ, JSON & MetaData entries that can be presented as a map overlay.

<b>Problem</b>: The SA Government Data Directory provides data that can be presented on a map but not the visualisation tools to display it in this manner.
